```

## üß† How It Works

### **Smart Analysis Process**

1. **File Upload** ‚Üí Bot downloads and reads log content
2. **AI Analysis** ‚Üí GPT-4 identifies issues and errors
3. **Solution Matching** ‚Üí Searches knowledge base for relevant fixes
4. **Smart Response** ‚Üí Combines analysis with known solutions

### **Knowledge Base Intelligence**

- **Relevance Scoring:** Matches keywords, categories, and context
- **Usage Tracking:** Popular solutions rank higher
- **AI Enhancement:** GPT-4 creates coherent responses from multiple solutions
- **Self-Learning:** Gets smarter as more people use it

## üóÇÔ∏è Database Structure

The bot uses SQLite with two main tables:

### **knowledge_base**

- Stores solutions with categories, keywords, and step-by-step fixes
- Tracks usage count for popularity-based ranking
- Community-contributed and self-improving

### **analysis_history**

- Keeps record of analyzed files per channel
- Enables context-aware follow-up questions
- Prevents duplicate analysis of same files

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### **File Limits**

- Maximum file size: 10MB
- Supported formats: .log, .txt, .json, and more
- Auto-cleanup: Contexts expire after 1 hour

### **AI Settings**

- Model: GPT-4o-mini for cost-effective analysis
- Temperature: 0.1 for consistent, factual responses
- Max tokens: Optimized for detailed but concise answers

### **Channel Isolation**

- Each Discord channel has its own context
- No mixing of conversations or file analysis
- Perfect for team environments

## üîß Default Knowledge

The bot comes pre-loaded with solutions for:

- **RPC Authentication Errors** (Solana/Web3)
- **Common Connection Issues**
- **Authentication Failures**

Add your own solutions using `/addknowledge`!

## üö® Error Handling

### **Graceful Fallbacks**

- If AI analysis fails ‚Üí Returns basic file info
- If JSON parsing fails ‚Üí Uses fallback analysis
- If knowledge search fails ‚Üí Shows manual search suggestions
- If responses are too long ‚Üí Auto-splits messages

### **Rate Limiting**

- Built-in OpenAI rate limit handling
- Automatic retry logic for transient failures
- User-friendly error messages

## ü§ù Contributing

### **Adding Knowledge**

The easiest way to improve the bot is by adding solutions:

1. Use `/addknowledge` command
2. Fill out category, keywords, and detailed solution
3. Your solution helps everyone in the server!

### **Best Practices for Solutions**

- **Category:** Short, descriptive (e.g., `rpc_error`, `database_timeout`)
- **Keywords:** Comma-separated terms people might search for
- **Solution:** Step-by-step instructions with clear formatting

## üìä Monitoring

### **Bot Health**

- Context cleanup every 30 minutes
- Database connection monitoring
- OpenAI API usage tracking

### **Usage Analytics**

- Track which solutions are most helpful
- Monitor analysis success rates
- Identify knowledge gaps

## üîê Security Notes

- Bot only reads uploaded files, never stores file contents permanently
- Knowledge base is local SQLite (not cloud-synced)
- OpenAI API calls include only necessary log excerpts
- Channel isolation prevents data leaks between teams

## üìà Roadmap

- [ ] Web dashboard for knowledge management
- [ ] Advanced log parsing for specific formats
- [ ] Integration with popular logging platforms
- [ ] Export/import knowledge base functionality
- [ ] Multi-language support
